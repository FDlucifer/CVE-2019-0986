# NtDataPoc
This PoC exploits "User Profile Service" (ProfSvc).  

Deletes all files within an arbitrary directory despite of the permissions set on that directory  
(excepts files that are currently in use from other SYSTEM processes).

Requisite for this : attacker user cannot have a current active session.  
This is way we are going to delete NTUSER.DAT file in order to trigger the right condition for exploitation.  
So, you shoud log in with another arbitrary "user_2" and exec the explot with user_1 (attacker) credentials.  




This has been tested on :  
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise N  
OS Version:                10.0.17763 N/A Build 17763
