## NtDataPoc
This PoC exploits "User Profile Service" (ProfSvc.dll).  

It will delete all files within an arbitrary directory despite of the permissions set on that directory  
(excepts files that are currently in use from other SYSTEM processes that are not able to delete).

Requisite for this:  
1) attacker user cannot have a current active session.  
2) attacker user must have an existing HOME directory. 

This is why we are going to delete NTUSER.DAT file (in the attacker HOME directory) in order to trigger the right condition for exploitation.  
So, next step: you shoud log in with another arbitrary "user_2" and exec the exploit with user_1 (attacker) credentials.  


You'll find a precompiled exe bin\x64\Debug directory   
```
Usage :
NtDataPoc USERNAME DOMAINNAME PASSWORD DIRECTORY_TO_DELETE
```
